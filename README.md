# Simple Unity Editor Rich Presence

This is a simple Discord Rich Presence script to add Rich Presence to your Unity Editor.\
It will show "Playing Unity" as your Discord status, show the project name and elapsed time.

**(This is an editor only script, not to be integrated into games !)**

I made this script using MarshMello0's code : https://github.com/MarshMello0/Editor-Rich-Presence \
It's basically a light version of their code, and without the stacking Rich Presence problem.

# Customization
You can choose the logo version you prefer by changing "unitylogo_white" to "unitylogo_dark" in the script.

By default the "state" is blank, you can add whatever you like to be displayed there. (It will replace the "Hello world" line showned in the images above)

You can basically change anything you want, I've let comments in the script on the variables you can change.
